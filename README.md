# Distributed Systems Concepts

## Introduction

A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system. These systems are designed to solve problems that are too large or complex for a single machine, offering advantages such as enhanced scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.

This repository explores the fundamental concepts, patterns, and infrastructure of distributed systems.

To navigate through the concepts in a structured manner and follow a recommended learning path, please refer to the [SUMMARY.md](./SUMMARY.md) file, which provides a comprehensive table of contents.
