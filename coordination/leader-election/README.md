# Leader Election

## Core

**Leader Election** is a fundamental problem in distributed systems where a unique process (the leader) needs to be chosen from a set of competing processes. The elected leader is typically responsible for coordinating tasks, managing shared resources, ensuring consistency, or handling specific operations that require a single point of control. This mechanism is crucial for many distributed algorithms and system architectures, especially in scenarios requiring strong consistency or centralized decision-making.

### Key Challenges

-   **Fault Tolerance:** The election process must be resilient to node failures (crashes, network partitions) and be able to elect a new leader if the current one fails.
-   **Uniqueness:** Only one leader should be elected at any given time to avoid split-brain scenarios where multiple nodes believe they are the leader, leading to inconsistencies.
-   **Efficiency:** The election process should be efficient in terms of messages exchanged and time taken, especially in large-scale systems.
-   **Fairness:** Ideally, all eligible nodes should have a fair chance of becoming the leader.

## Algorithms

-   **Bully Algorithm:** A simple algorithm where the process with the highest identifier (e.g., IP address, process ID) is elected as the leader. When a process detects a leader failure, it initiates an election by sending election messages to all processes with higher identifiers. If no one responds, it declares itself the leader. If a higher-ranked process responds, that process takes over the election.
-   **Ring Algorithm:** Processes are arranged in a logical ring. When a process detects a leader failure, it sends an election message with its identifier around the ring. Processes compare identifiers and forward the message with the highest ID seen so far. When the message completes a full circle, the process that initiated the election and receives its own message knows the highest ID and declares that process as the leader.
-   **Paxos/Raft:** These are consensus algorithms that inherently solve the leader election problem as part of their mechanism to achieve agreement on a single value or state. They are more robust and widely used in practice for critical systems.

## Which service use it?

-   **Distributed Databases (e.g., Apache Cassandra, MongoDB replica sets):** To designate a primary node for writes and coordinate replication.
-   **Distributed Coordination Services (e.g., Apache ZooKeeper, etcd):** These services themselves use leader election to ensure a consistent and highly available shared state, and they also provide leader election primitives for client applications.
-   **Message Queues (e.g., Apache Kafka):** For partition leaders to manage message offsets and replication.
-   **Container Orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes):** For electing leaders among control plane components (e.g., `kube-controller-manager`, `kube-scheduler`) to ensure only one instance is active.
