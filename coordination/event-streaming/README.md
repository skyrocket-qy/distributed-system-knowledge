# Event Streaming

## Core

This section explores event streaming as a coordination pattern in distributed systems, enabling real-time data flow and integration.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Data Flow** | Continuous, real-time flow of events. |
| **Decoupling** | Producers and consumers are highly decoupled. |
| **Scalability** | Highly scalable for high-throughput data. |
| **Durability** | Events are typically persisted for a configurable duration. |

## Which service use it?



-   **Real-time Analytics and Monitoring:** Event streaming platforms are used to ingest and process massive volumes of real-time data (e.g., user clicks, sensor readings, application logs) for immediate insights and anomaly detection.

-   **IoT Data Processing:** Ingesting and processing data from a multitude of IoT devices, enabling real-time reactions and data analysis at scale.

-   **Microservices Communication:** Event streaming serves as a backbone for asynchronous communication between microservices, allowing them to react to events generated by other services without tight coupling.

-   **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Capturing changes from databases in real-time and streaming them to other systems (e.g., data warehouses, search indexes) to keep them up-to-date.

-   **Fraud Detection:** Analyzing streams of financial transactions in real-time to identify and flag suspicious activities.

-   **Personalization and Recommendation Engines:** Processing user behavior events in real-time to provide personalized content and product recommendations.
