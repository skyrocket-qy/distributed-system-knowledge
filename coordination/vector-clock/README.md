# Vector Clocks

## Core

This section explains Vector Clocks as a mechanism for tracking causality and achieving coordination in distributed systems.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Causal Ordering** | Provides a strong guarantee of causal ordering. |
| **Conflict Detection** | Excellent at detecting concurrent updates. |
| **Complexity** | More complex to implement and manage than simple timestamps. |
| **Overhead** | Can incur storage and communication overhead with many nodes. |

## Which service use it?



-   **Distributed Databases (e.g., Riak):** Riak uses vector clocks to detect and manage concurrent updates, allowing applications to resolve conflicts when they read data.

-   **Collaborative Editing Systems:** In applications where multiple users can edit a document simultaneously, vector clocks can help in merging changes by understanding the causal relationships between different edits.

-   **Distributed File Systems:** Some distributed file systems use vector clocks to track the causal history of file versions, helping to resolve conflicts when files are modified concurrently.

-   **Version Control Systems:** While not always explicitly called vector clocks, the underlying principles of tracking divergent histories and merging them are similar to how vector clocks help manage concurrent updates.

-   **Eventual Consistency Systems:** Vector clocks are a fundamental tool in many eventually consistent systems to ensure that causally related events are processed in the correct order, even if physical timestamps are unreliable.

## Related Concepts

-   **Coordination:** Vector clocks serve as a crucial coordination mechanism in distributed systems by providing a way to track the causal relationships between events across different nodes, enabling proper ordering and conflict detection. [Explore other Coordination techniques](../README.md).

-   **Conflict Resolution:** Vector clocks are instrumental in detecting concurrent updates to data, which is a prerequisite for effective conflict resolution. They allow systems to identify when two operations are causally unrelated and thus potentially conflicting. [Learn more about Vector Clocks for Conflict Resolution](../../conflict-resolution/vector-clocks/README.md).

-   **Causal Consistency:** Vector clocks are the foundational mechanism for implementing causal consistency, ensuring that if one event causally precedes another, then every process that observes the second event must also observe the first event. [Explore Causal Consistency](../../consistency-models/causal-consistency/README.md).

-   **Eventual Consistency:** In eventually consistent systems, vector clocks help manage and reconcile divergent states by providing a clear understanding of the causal history of updates, facilitating the convergence of replicas. [Understand Eventual Consistency](../../consistency-models/eventual-consistency/README.md).

-   **Timestamps with Logical Clocks:** Vector clocks are a more advanced form of logical clock compared to simple Lamport timestamps, offering the ability to detect concurrency directly rather than just providing a total ordering. [Compare with Timestamps with Logical Clocks](../../conflict-resolution/timestamps-with-logical-clocks/README.md).
