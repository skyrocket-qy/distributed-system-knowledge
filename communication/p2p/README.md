# Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication

## Core

This section explains Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication, a decentralized communication model where each node can act as both a client and a server, directly exchanging data with other nodes.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Decentralization** | No central authority; nodes act as both clients and servers. |
| **Scalability** | Can scale well as more peers join the network. |
| **Resilience** | Highly fault-tolerant due to distributed nature. |
| **Complexity** | Can be complex to manage and ensure consistency. |

## Which service use it?



-   **File Sharing Networks (e.g., BitTorrent):** Users directly share files with each other without a central server mediating the transfers.

-   **Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum):** The blockchain is maintained and validated by a decentralized network of peer nodes, where each node holds a copy of the ledger and participates in transaction verification.

-   **Distributed Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Some CDNs use P2P principles to distribute content more efficiently, allowing users to download content from nearby peers.

-   **Some Online Gaming Platforms:** Certain games use P2P connections for direct communication between players, especially for real-time multiplayer experiences.

-   **Decentralized Web Technologies:** Projects building decentralized web (Web3) often rely on P2P communication for data storage, content distribution, and application hosting.
