# Distributed Consensus



This section discusses consensus mechanisms specifically in the context of distributed coordination.

## Key Challenges

Achieving distributed consensus is a fundamental problem in distributed systems, fraught with several challenges:

-   **Network Partitions:** The network can split, isolating nodes from each other, making it difficult for them to agree on a common state.
-   **Node Failures:** Nodes can crash, restart, or become unresponsive, requiring the system to continue operating correctly despite these failures.
-   **Asynchronous Communication:** Messages can be delayed, lost, or reordered, making it hard to establish a global order of events.
-   **Byzantine Faults:** Malicious or faulty nodes might send incorrect or contradictory information, actively trying to disrupt the consensus process.
-   **Performance Overhead:** Consensus algorithms often involve multiple rounds of communication, which can introduce significant latency and reduce throughput.
-   **Complexity:** Designing and implementing correct and efficient consensus algorithms is inherently complex and prone to subtle bugs.
