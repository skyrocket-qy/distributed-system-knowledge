# Snapshot Recovery

## Core

This section describes Snapshot Recovery as a fault-tolerance mechanism, where the state of a distributed system is periodically saved to allow for quick restoration after a failure.

## Characteristics

- **Point-in-time Recovery**: Snapshots provide a point-in-time recovery of the system's state.
- **Data Loss**: Data loss can occur between the last snapshot and the time of failure.
- **Performance Overhead**: Taking snapshots can be a resource-intensive operation.
- **Storage Overhead**: Snapshots can consume a significant amount of storage space.
- **Consistency**: Snapshots must be consistent across all nodes in the system.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Recovery Time** | Fast, direct restoration from a saved state. |
| **Data Loss** | Data loss up to the last snapshot. |
| **Overhead** | Can be high, depending on snapshot frequency and data size. |
| **Complexity** | Relatively simple to implement for individual components. |

## Trade-offs

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|
| **Fast Recovery**: Snapshots provide a fast way to recover from failures. | **Data Loss**: Data loss can occur between the last snapshot and the time of failure. |
| **Simple**: Snapshots are relatively simple to implement. | **Performance Overhead**: Taking snapshots can be a resource-intensive operation. |
| **Consistent**: Snapshots can be taken in a consistent state. | **Storage Overhead**: Snapshots can consume a significant amount of storage space. |

## Which service use it?



-   **Distributed Databases:** Many distributed databases (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch) provide snapshot capabilities to create consistent backups of their data at a specific point in time, which can then be used for recovery.

-   **Virtual Machine (VM) Backups:** Virtualization platforms allow taking snapshots of entire VMs, including their memory, disk state, and configuration, enabling quick restoration to a previous state.

-   **Distributed File Systems:** File systems like ZFS or Btrfs support snapshotting, allowing users to revert to previous versions of files or entire file systems.

-   **Cloud Storage Services:** Cloud providers offer snapshot features for block storage volumes (e.g., AWS EBS snapshots) or entire virtual disks, facilitating disaster recovery and data migration.

-   **Data Warehouses and Analytics Platforms:** Snapshots are often used to create consistent copies of large datasets for reporting, analysis, or testing purposes, without impacting the live system.

## Related Concepts

-   **Fault Tolerance:** Snapshot recovery is a direct and effective fault tolerance mechanism, enabling systems to quickly restore to a known good state after a failure, minimizing downtime and data loss. [Explore other Fault Tolerance strategies](../README.md).

-   **Data Replication:** Snapshots are often used in conjunction with data replication strategies to create consistent backups of replicated data, providing a point-in-time recovery option for the entire dataset. [Understand Data Replication](../../data-replication/README.md).

-   **Checkpointing:** Snapshot recovery is closely related to checkpointing, where the state of a process or system is periodically saved. Snapshots typically refer to a broader system state, while checkpointing can be more granular. [Compare with Checkpointing](../checkpoint/README.md).

-   **Consistency Models:** Ensuring a consistent snapshot across a distributed system, especially one with concurrent writes, requires careful consideration of consistency models to guarantee that the captured state is valid and coherent.
