# Consensus-Based Recovery

## Core

This section discusses Consensus-Based Recovery, where distributed consensus algorithms are leveraged to ensure consistent state recovery after failures in a distributed system.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Consistency** | Strong consistency guarantees during recovery. |
| **Complexity** | High, due to the nature of consensus algorithms. |
| **Recovery Time** | Can be slower due to coordination overhead. |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Highly fault-tolerant, can withstand multiple failures. |

## Which service use it?



-   **Distributed Databases (e.g., Google Spanner, CockroachDB):** These databases use consensus algorithms (like Paxos or Raft) to ensure that all replicas agree on the state of the data, enabling consistent recovery after node failures.

-   **State Machine Replication:** Systems that implement state machine replication (where all nodes execute the same sequence of operations) rely on consensus for fault tolerance and consistent recovery.

-   **Distributed Coordination Services (e.g., etcd, Apache ZooKeeper):** These services use consensus to maintain a consistent, highly available store for configuration data, service discovery, and leader election, allowing them to recover their state even after multiple node failures.

-   **Blockchain Technologies:** The underlying consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) in blockchains are a form of consensus-based recovery, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the distributed ledger even in the presence of malicious actors or failures.

## Related Concepts

-   **Fault Tolerance:** Consensus-based recovery is a highly robust fault tolerance mechanism, enabling distributed systems to recover to a consistent state even after multiple node failures by leveraging agreement among participants. [Explore other Fault Tolerance strategies](../README.md).

-   **Distributed Consensus:** The core of consensus-based recovery lies in distributed consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft), which allow a group of nodes to agree on a single value or state despite failures. [Learn more about Distributed Consensus](../../distributed-consensus/README.md).

-   **Strong Consistency:** Consensus algorithms are fundamental for achieving strong consistency, ensuring that all nodes in a distributed system maintain a consistent view of the data, which is critical for reliable recovery. [Explore Strong Consistency](../../consistency-models/strong-consistency/README.md).

-   **Coordination:** Consensus protocols are a sophisticated form of coordination, enabling distributed components to make collective decisions and maintain a coherent global state, especially during recovery operations. [Discover Coordination Concepts](../../coordination/README.md).

-   **Data Replication:** Consensus is often employed in replicated data systems to ensure that all replicas are consistently updated and that a valid state can be recovered across the entire replicated dataset after a failure. [Understand Data Replication](../../data-replication/README.md).
