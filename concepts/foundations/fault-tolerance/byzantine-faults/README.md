# Byzantine Faults



Byzantine faults are a class of fault tolerance problems in distributed computing where components of a system can fail in arbitrary ways, including malicious behavior, sending conflicting information to different parts of the system, or failing to respond. This is the most general and difficult class of failures to deal with.

## Characteristics

-   **Arbitrary Failure:** Nodes can fail in any way, including malicious or unpredictable behavior.
-   **Conflicting Information:** Faulty nodes can send different information to different honest nodes.
-   **Difficult to Detect:** Detecting Byzantine faults is challenging due to their arbitrary nature.
