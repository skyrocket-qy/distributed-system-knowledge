# Concurrency Control

## Core

Concurrency control in distributed systems refers to the mechanisms used to ensure that concurrent operations on shared data do not violate the data's correctness. It addresses the challenges that arise when multiple transactions or processes access and modify the same data simultaneously. Without effective concurrency control, systems can suffer from data corruption, inconsistencies, and race conditions, leading to unreliable behavior.

The primary goal of concurrency control is to manage the execution of concurrent operations in a way that maintains data integrity while maximizing system performance. This involves preventing undesirable phenomena such as lost updates, dirty reads, and non-repeatable reads. By coordinating access to shared resources, concurrency control protocols ensure that the system behaves as if all operations were executed in a sequential, well-defined order.

## Characteristics

- **Isolation**: Concurrency control mechanisms provide isolation, which ensures that each transaction appears to execute in isolation from others. This is one of the key properties of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- **Correctness**: They maintain the correctness of data by preventing race conditions and conflicts that could lead to inconsistencies.
- **Performance**: The choice of concurrency control strategy can significantly impact system performance, affecting throughput and latency.
- **Scalability**: Effective concurrency control is essential for building scalable systems that can handle a high volume of concurrent requests.

## Comparison

- **Optimistic vs. Pessimistic**: Concurrency control strategies are often categorized as either optimistic or pessimistic. Pessimistic approaches, like locking, prevent conflicts from happening, while optimistic methods, like versioning, detect and resolve them after they occur.
- **Granularity**: The granularity of concurrency control can range from fine-grained (e.g., locking a single record) to coarse-grained (e.g., locking an entire table), which has implications for performance and complexity.

## Trade-offs

- **Performance vs. Consistency**: Stricter concurrency control models, such as two-phase locking, provide strong consistency guarantees but can introduce performance overhead due to contention and deadlocks.
- **Complexity vs. Scalability**: Simpler concurrency control mechanisms may be easier to implement but may not scale well in highly concurrent environments, whereas more advanced techniques can offer better scalability at the cost of increased complexity.
- **Deadlocks**: Pessimistic concurrency control methods, particularly those involving locks, can lead to deadlocks, where two or more transactions are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources.
