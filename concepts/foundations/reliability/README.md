# Reliability

## Core

Reliability is the probability that a system will perform its intended function without failure for a specified period. In distributed systems, reliability is a critical attribute, as it ensures that the system can be trusted to operate correctly and consistently over time.

Reliability is closely related to availability and fault tolerance, but it focuses on the correctness of the system's behavior, rather than just its uptime.

## Characteristics

-   **Fault Prevention:** Techniques to prevent failures from occurring in the first place.
-   **Fault Detection:** Mechanisms to detect failures when they occur.
-   **Fault Recovery:** Strategies to recover from failures and restore the system to a correct state.

## Comparison

| Approach             | Description                                          | Use Case                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Replication**      | Maintaining multiple copies of data or components.   | Improves reliability by providing redundancy.      |
| **Transactions**     | Ensuring that a sequence of operations is atomic.    | Guarantees data consistency in the event of failures. |
| **Error Handling**   | Implementing robust error handling and retry mechanisms. | Improves the resilience of the system to transient failures. |

## Trade-offs

*   **Reliability vs. Performance:** Implementing reliability mechanisms can introduce overhead and impact system performance.
*   **Cost:** Achieving high reliability often requires additional hardware and software, which can increase costs.
*   **Complexity:** Reliability solutions can be complex to design, implement, and test.
