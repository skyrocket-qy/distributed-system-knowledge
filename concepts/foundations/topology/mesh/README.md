# Mesh Topology

This section explains the Mesh topology in distributed systems.

## Which service use it?



-   **Backbone Networks of the Internet:** The core routing infrastructure of the internet uses a highly interconnected mesh topology to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

-   **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs):** In WSNs, sensors often form a mesh network to relay data to a central sink, providing redundancy and extending network coverage.

-   **Critical Infrastructure Communications:** Systems requiring extremely high reliability, such as military communications or power grid control systems, often employ mesh topologies.

-   **Some Distributed Databases:** Certain distributed databases or storage systems might use a full or partial mesh topology for inter-node communication to ensure data replication and consistency.

-   **Service Meshes (e.g., Istio, Linkerd):** While not a physical network topology, the concept of a service mesh creates a logical mesh of communication between microservices, providing features like traffic management, observability, and security.

## Related Concepts

-   **Topology:** Mesh topology is a highly interconnected network arrangement where nodes have multiple paths to communicate with each other, offering superior redundancy and resilience in distributed systems. [Explore other Network Topologies](../README.md).

-   **Ring Topology:** In contrast to a mesh, a ring topology connects each node to exactly two other nodes, providing a single path for data flow, which can be less fault-tolerant than a mesh. [Compare with Ring Topology](../ring/README.md).

-   **Fault Tolerance:** Mesh topologies inherently provide high fault tolerance, as the failure of a single link or node does not isolate other nodes, and communication can be rerouted through alternative paths. [Understand Fault Tolerance](../../fault-tolerance/README.md).

-   **Communication:** The multiple communication paths in a mesh topology enhance communication reliability and can reduce latency by allowing data to travel along the most efficient route between nodes. [Explore Communication Patterns](../../communication/README.md).

-   **Service Discovery:** In large and dynamic mesh networks, especially those involving microservices, service discovery mechanisms are crucial for efficiently locating and communicating with various service instances across the interconnected nodes. [Understand Service Discovery](../../service-discovery/README.md).
