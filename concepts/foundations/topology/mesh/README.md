# Mesh Topology

## Core

This section explains the Mesh topology in distributed systems. In a mesh topology, each network device is interconnected with every other device.

## Characteristics

- **Reliability**: Mesh topology is highly reliable due to the presence of multiple paths between any two nodes.
- **Scalability**: It is difficult to add new nodes to a mesh network.
- **Cost**: Mesh topology is expensive to implement due to the large amount of cabling required.
- **Performance**: Mesh topology offers high performance due to the presence of dedicated links between nodes.
- **Complexity**: Mesh topology is complex to manage and troubleshoot.

## Comparison

| Topology | Reliability | Scalability | Cost | Performance | Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mesh** | High | Low | High | High | High |
| **Star** | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Bus** | Low | Low | Low | Low | Low |
| **Ring** | Medium | Low | Medium | Medium | Medium |

## Trade-offs

- **Reliability vs. Cost**: Mesh topology is highly reliable, but it is also expensive.
- **Performance vs. Complexity**: Mesh topology offers high performance, but it is also complex to manage.

## Which service use it?



-   **Backbone Networks of the Internet:** The core routing infrastructure of the internet uses a highly interconnected mesh topology to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

-   **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs):** In WSNs, sensors often form a mesh network to relay data to a central sink, providing redundancy and extending network coverage.

-   **Critical Infrastructure Communications:** Systems requiring extremely high reliability, such as military communications or power grid control systems, often employ mesh topologies.

-   **Some Distributed Databases:** Certain distributed databases or storage systems might use a full or partial mesh topology for inter-node communication to ensure data replication and consistency.

-   **Service Meshes (e.g., Istio, Linkerd):** While not a physical network topology, the concept of a service mesh creates a logical mesh of communication between microservices, providing features like traffic management, observability, and security.
