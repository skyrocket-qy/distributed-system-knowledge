# Ring Topology

This section explains the Ring topology in distributed systems.

## Which service use it?



-   **Token Ring Networks:** Historically, Token Ring was a popular LAN technology that used a ring topology for data transmission.

-   **Storage Area Networks (SANs):** Some Fibre Channel SANs can be configured in a ring topology for high availability and performance.

-   **Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs):** Many DHT implementations (e.g., Chord, Pastry) conceptually form a ring structure to distribute data and facilitate lookups in peer-to-peer networks.

-   **Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs):** In some urban areas, fiber optic networks are laid out in a ring topology to provide high-speed and resilient connectivity.

-   **Apache Cassandra:** While Cassandra's architecture is more complex, its data distribution and replication model can be conceptually mapped to a ring (or torus) where nodes are responsible for a range of data.

## Related Concepts

-   **Topology:** Ring topology is a network arrangement where each node is connected to exactly two other nodes, forming a single continuous pathway for signals through each node. [Explore other Network Topologies](../README.md).

-   **Mesh Topology:** In contrast to a ring, a mesh topology provides multiple paths between nodes, offering higher redundancy and fault tolerance but with increased cabling and complexity. [Compare with Mesh Topology](../mesh/README.md).

-   **Peer-to-Peer Communication:** Ring topologies are often employed in peer-to-peer networks, particularly in the design of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), to efficiently route requests and distribute data among peers. [Understand Peer-to-Peer Communication](../../communication/p2p/README.md).

-   **Fault Tolerance:** While a simple ring topology can be vulnerable to a single node or link failure, implementations often include redundancy (e.g., dual rings) to enhance fault tolerance and ensure continuous operation. [Understand Fault Tolerance](../../fault-tolerance/README.md).

-   **Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs):** Many DHT implementations, such as Chord, conceptually organize nodes in a ring structure to facilitate efficient data lookup and distribution in decentralized systems. [Explore Decentralized Service Discovery (which uses DHTs)](../../service-discovery/decentralized-discovery/README.md).
