# Tree Topology

## Core

This section explains the Tree topology in distributed systems. A tree topology is a hybrid topology that combines the characteristics of a bus topology and a star topology.

## Characteristics

- **Scalability**: Tree topology is highly scalable, as new nodes can be added to the network as leaf nodes.
- **Hierarchical**: Tree topology has a hierarchical structure, which makes it easy to manage.
- **Single Point of Failure**: The root node of the tree is a single point of failure.
- **Complexity**: Tree topology is more complex than bus or star topology.
- **Cost**: Tree topology is more expensive than bus or star topology.

## Comparison

| Topology | Scalability | Complexity | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tree** | High | High | High |
| **Star** | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Bus** | Low | Low | Low |

## Trade-offs

- **Scalability vs. Complexity**: Tree topology is highly scalable, but it is also complex to manage.
- **Cost vs. Reliability**: Tree topology is expensive, and the root node is a single point of failure.

## Which service use it?



-   **Large Corporate Networks:** Many large organizations use a tree topology to structure their network, with a root switch connecting to core switches, which then connect to distribution switches, and finally to access switches where end devices are connected.

-   **Cable TV Networks:** Cable television systems often use a tree topology to distribute signals from a central headend to individual subscribers.

-   **Hierarchical Network Designs:** Any network that requires a hierarchical structure for management, security, or performance segmentation can employ a tree topology.

-   **Distributed File Systems (Conceptual):** Some distributed file systems or data storage solutions might conceptually organize their nodes or data in a tree-like hierarchy for efficient data access and management.
