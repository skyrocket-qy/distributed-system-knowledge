# Quorum

## Core

This section explains the concept of Quorum in distributed systems, particularly its role in ensuring consistency and availability for coordination.

## Characteristics

- **Consistency**: Quorum-based systems provide tunable consistency, allowing a trade-off between consistency and availability.
- **Availability**: Quorum-based systems can remain available even if some nodes fail.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Quorum-based systems are resilient to a certain number of node failures.
- **Latency**: The latency of an operation depends on the number of nodes in the quorum.
- **Scalability**: Quorum-based systems can be scaled by adding more nodes.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Consistency** | Configurable, balancing consistency and availability. |
| **Availability** | Can maintain availability during some node failures. |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Tolerates failures up to a certain threshold. |
| **Complexity** | Adds complexity in configuration and management. |

## Trade-offs

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|
| **Tunable Consistency**: Quorum-based systems provide tunable consistency. | **Complexity**: Quorum-based systems can be complex to configure and manage. |
| **Availability**: Quorum-based systems can remain available even if some nodes fail. | **Latency**: The latency of an operation depends on the number of nodes in the quorum. |
| **Fault Tolerance**: Quorum-based systems are resilient to a certain number of node failures. | **Scalability**: Quorum-based systems can be scaled by adding more nodes. |

## Which service use it?



-   **Distributed Storage Systems (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB):** These systems allow users to configure read and write quorums to achieve desired consistency levels. For example, a write quorum of `W` means `W` replicas must acknowledge a write before it's considered successful.

-   **Consensus Algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft):** These algorithms fundamentally rely on a majority (quorum) of nodes to agree on a decision (e.g., leader election, log entry commitment) to ensure consistency and fault tolerance.

-   **Distributed Coordination Services (e.g., Apache ZooKeeper, etcd):** These services use quorum-based protocols to maintain a consistent and highly available shared state, which is crucial for distributed locks, leader election, and configuration management.

-   **Distributed File Systems:** Some distributed file systems use quorum-like mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability, especially when dealing with metadata or critical control plane operations.

## Related Concepts

-   **Coordination:** Quorum is a fundamental coordination mechanism in distributed systems, enabling a group of nodes to make decisions or perform operations by requiring a minimum number of participants to agree. [Explore other Coordination techniques](../README.md).

-   **Distributed Consensus:** Quorum is a cornerstone of many distributed consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft), where a majority of nodes must agree on a decision to ensure consistency and fault tolerance. [Learn more about Distributed Consensus](../../distributed-consensus/README.md).

-   **Consistency Models:** The concept of quorum allows for tunable consistency, enabling systems to balance strong consistency with availability and performance by adjusting the number of replicas required for read and write operations. [Explore Consistency Models](../../consistency-models/README.md).

-   **Fault Tolerance:** Quorum-based systems are inherently fault-tolerant, as they can continue to operate and maintain consistency even if a minority of nodes fail, provided the quorum threshold is still met. [Understand Fault Tolerance](../../fault-tolerance/README.md).

-   **Data Replication:** Quorum reads and writes are commonly used in replicated storage systems to ensure data integrity and availability across multiple copies of data, allowing for flexible consistency guarantees. [Understand Data Replication](../../data-replication/README.md).
