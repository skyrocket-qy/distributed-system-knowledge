# Coordination

## Core

**Coordination** is the process of managing the interactions and dependencies between multiple processes in a distributed system. In a distributed environment, where processes are running on different nodes and communicating over a network, it's essential to have mechanisms in place to ensure that they can work together in a consistent and orderly manner.

Without proper coordination, a distributed system can suffer from a variety of problems, including:
- **Race Conditions:** When multiple processes attempt to access the same shared resource at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.
- **Deadlocks:** When two or more processes are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource.
- **Inconsistent State:** When different nodes in the system have different views of the same data.

### Key Challenges

-   **Distributed Consensus:** Reaching agreement among multiple nodes on a single data value or decision, even in the presence of failures. See [Distributed Consensus](../distributed-consensus/README.md) for more details.
-   **Leader Election:** Dynamically selecting a single coordinator (leader) from a group of nodes.
-   **Distributed Transactions:** Ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties across multiple independent operations in a distributed environment.
-   **Clock Synchronization:** Maintaining a consistent notion of time across distributed nodes, which is crucial for ordering events.
-   **Failure Handling:** Designing coordination mechanisms that are resilient to node crashes, network partitions, and other failures.

## Characteristics

- **Consistency**: Coordination mechanisms are used to ensure consistency in a distributed system.
- **Ordering**: Coordination mechanisms are used to order events and operations.
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Coordination mechanisms are used to ensure that only one process can access a shared resource at a time.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Coordination mechanisms are designed to be resilient to failures.
- **Scalability**: Coordination mechanisms should be scalable to a large number of nodes.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[Quorum](./quorum)** | Consistency | Medium | Medium | Read/write operations in replicated systems |
| **[Gossip](./gossip)** | Dissemination | High | Low | Cluster membership, failure detection |
| **[Vector Clock](../conflict-resolution/vector-clocks)** | Causality | High | Medium | Detecting concurrent updates, versioning |
| **[CRDT](../conflict-resolution/crdts)** | Conflict-free replication | High | High | Collaborative applications, enabling automatic conflict resolution as seen in [Conflict Resolution](../conflict-resolution/README.md) and used in [Data Replication](../data-replication/README.md) |
| **[Event Streaming](./event-streaming)** | Data flow | High | Medium | Real-time data processing, microservices |
| **[Leader Election](./leader-election)** | Fault Tolerance | Medium | Medium | Consensus, distributed databases |

## Trade-offs

| Mechanism | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|
| **Quorum** | Ensures consistency, tunable | Can reduce availability |
| **Gossip** | Highly scalable, resilient | Eventual consistency, no delivery guarantees |
| **Vector Clock** | Causal ordering, detects concurrency | Overhead of maintaining clocks |
| **CRDT** | Conflict-free, highly available | Complex to design and implement |
| **Event Streaming** | Decoupling, scalability | Can be complex to manage, potential for latency |
| **Leader Election** | Simplifies coordination, fault-tolerant | Leader can be a bottleneck |
| **Distributed Locks** | Ensures mutual exclusion | Can reduce performance, risk of deadlock |

## Which service use it?



-   **Quorum:** Distributed storage systems (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB), and any system requiring a certain number of nodes to agree on an operation for consistency.

-   **Gossip:** Cluster membership management (e.g., HashiCorp Serf, Apache Cassandra), failure detection, and data dissemination in large-scale distributed systems.

-   **Vector Clock:** Collaborative editing applications, distributed databases (e.g., Riak), and systems needing to track causal relationships between events.

-   **CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types):** Real-time collaborative applications (e.g., Google Docs-like editors), distributed counters, and shared data structures in eventually consistent systems.

-   **Event Streaming:** Microservices architectures, real-time analytics platforms, IoT data processing, and any system requiring asynchronous, decoupled communication and data flow.
