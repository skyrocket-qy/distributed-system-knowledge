# Event Streaming

## Core

This section explores event streaming as a coordination pattern in distributed systems, enabling real-time data flow and integration.

## Characteristics

- **Real-time**: Events are processed in real-time as they are generated.
- **Scalable**: Event streaming platforms are highly scalable and can handle a large volume of events.
- **Durable**: Events are stored in a durable log and can be replayed.
- **Decoupled**: Producers and consumers of events are decoupled and can evolve independently.
- **Ordered**: Events are typically ordered within a partition.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Data Flow** | Continuous, real-time flow of events. |
| **Decoupling** | Producers and consumers are highly decoupled. |
| **Scalability** | Highly scalable for high-throughput data. |
| **Durability** | Events are typically persisted for a configurable duration. |

## Trade-offs

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|
| **Real-time**: Events are processed in real-time as they are generated. | **Complexity**: Event streaming platforms can be complex to set up and manage. |
| **Scalable**: Event streaming platforms are highly scalable and can handle a large volume of events. | **Cost**: Event streaming platforms can be expensive to operate. |
| **Durable**: Events are stored in a durable log and can be replayed. | **Latency**: Event streaming platforms can introduce latency. |

## Which service use it?



-   **Real-time Analytics and Monitoring:** Event streaming platforms are used to ingest and process massive volumes of real-time data (e.g., user clicks, sensor readings, application logs) for immediate insights and anomaly detection.

-   **IoT Data Processing:** Ingesting and processing data from a multitude of IoT devices, enabling real-time reactions and data analysis at scale.

-   **Microservices Communication:** Event streaming serves as a backbone for asynchronous communication between microservices, allowing them to react to events generated by other services without tight coupling.

-   **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Capturing changes from databases in real-time and streaming them to other systems (e.g., data warehouses, search indexes) to keep them up-to-date.

-   **Fraud Detection:** Analyzing streams of financial transactions in real-time to identify and flag suspicious activities.

-   **Personalization and Recommendation Engines:** Processing user behavior events in real-time to provide personalized content and product recommendations.

## Related Concepts

-   **Coordination:** Event streaming serves as a powerful coordination pattern in distributed systems, enabling loosely coupled components to react to real-time data flows and integrate their functionalities asynchronously. [Explore other Coordination techniques](../README.md).

-   **Messaging:** Event streaming is a specialized form of messaging, often built upon publish-subscribe principles, designed for high-throughput, durable, and ordered delivery of events across a distributed system. [Explore Messaging Systems](../../messaging/README.md).

-   **Publish-Subscribe:** Event streaming platforms typically implement a publish-subscribe model, where event producers publish messages to topics, and multiple consumers can subscribe to these topics to receive and process events. [Understand Publish-Subscribe](../../messaging/publish-subscribe/README.md).

-   **Event-Driven System Mode:** Event streaming is a cornerstone of event-driven architectures, where the entire system's behavior is orchestrated by the flow of events, enabling reactive, scalable, and resilient designs. [Discover Event-Driven Systems](../../system-mode/event-driven/README.md).

-   **Scaling:** Event streaming platforms are designed for massive scalability, capable of handling and processing vast volumes of real-time data, making them essential for applications with high data throughput requirements. [Learn about Scaling](../../scaling/README.md).

-   **Data Replication:** The durable log of events in an event streaming platform can be considered a form of data replication, ensuring that events are not lost and can be replayed to reconstruct state or recover from failures. [Understand Data Replication](../../data-replication/README.md).
