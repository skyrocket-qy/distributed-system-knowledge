# Security in Distributed Systems

## Core

**Security in Distributed Systems** is paramount due to the inherent complexities and vulnerabilities introduced by multiple interconnected components, network communication, and diverse deployment environments. Unlike monolithic applications, distributed systems face a broader attack surface, making robust security measures essential to protect data, ensure system integrity, and maintain availability.

The goal of security in distributed systems is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of data and services across all nodes and communication channels, even in the presence of malicious actors or compromised components.

### Key Challenges

-   **Expanded Attack Surface:** More components, network endpoints, and communication paths mean more potential entry points for attackers.
-   **Secure Communication:** Ensuring that data exchanged between services is encrypted and authenticated to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
-   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Managing and verifying the identities of services and users, and controlling their access to resources across the distributed environment.
-   **Data Protection:** Protecting data at rest and in transit, including encryption, data masking, and secure storage.
-   **Trust Boundaries:** Defining and enforcing trust relationships between different services and components, especially in microservices architectures.
-   **Vulnerability Management:** Continuously identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities across all components and dependencies.
-   **Auditing and Logging:** Collecting and analyzing security-related events to detect and respond to incidents.
-   **Supply Chain Security:** Ensuring the security of third-party libraries, frameworks, and services used in the distributed system.

## Characteristics

- **Confidentiality**: Preventing the unauthorized disclosure of information.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring that data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that systems and data are accessible when needed.
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users and systems.
- **Authorization**: Granting or denying access to resources.
- **Non-repudiation**: Ensuring that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or the sending of a message that they originated.

## Comparison

| Mechanism | Purpose | Implementation Complexity | Impact on Performance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Verify identity | Medium to High (depending on method) | Low to Medium (initial handshake) |
| **Authorization** | Control access to resources | Medium to High (fine-grained policies) | Low to Medium (policy evaluation) |
| **Encryption** | Protect data confidentiality | Medium (key management, algorithm choice) | Medium to High (CPU overhead) |
| **Digital Signatures** | Verify integrity and authenticity | Medium (key management, signing/verification) | Medium (CPU overhead) |
| **Firewalls & Network Segmentation** | Restrict network access | Medium (rule configuration) | Low (packet filtering) |

## Trade-offs

- **Security vs. Performance**: Security measures can introduce performance overhead.
- **Security vs. Usability**: Security measures can make a system more difficult to use.
- **Security vs. Cost**: Security measures can be expensive to implement and maintain.

## Common Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Verifying the identity of a user or service. | Ensures only legitimate entities can access the system. |
| **Authorization** | Determining what an authenticated user or service is permitted to do. | Controls access to specific resources and actions. |
| **Encryption** | Transforming data to protect its confidentiality. | Protects data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest (disk encryption). |
| **Digital Signatures** | Cryptographic technique to verify the authenticity and integrity of data. | Ensures data has not been tampered with and comes from a trusted source. |
| **Firewalls & Network Segmentation** | Controlling network traffic and isolating components. | Reduces the attack surface and limits lateral movement of attackers. |
| **API Security** | Protecting APIs from common attacks (e.g., injection, DDoS). | Secures the interfaces through which services communicate. |
| **Secrets Management** | Securely storing and managing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords). | Prevents hardcoding sensitive data and provides secure access. |
| **Security Auditing & Logging** | Recording and reviewing security-relevant events. | Detects suspicious activities and aids in forensic analysis. |
| **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)** | Monitoring network or system activities for malicious behavior. | Identifies and potentially blocks security threats. |
