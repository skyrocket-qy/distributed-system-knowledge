# Multi-Leader Replication

## Core

This section explains Multi-Leader Replication, a data replication strategy where multiple nodes can act as leaders, accepting writes and then replicating them to other leaders and followers, often used for multi-datacenter deployments.

## Characteristics

- **High Write Availability**: Multiple nodes can accept writes, providing high write availability.
- **Low Write Latency**: Clients can write to the nearest leader, reducing write latency.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Multi-leader replication requires a mechanism to resolve conflicts that can arise from concurrent writes to different leaders.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Data is typically eventually consistent across all leader nodes.
- **Complexity**: Multi-leader replication is complex to implement and manage.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Write Availability** | High, writes can occur at multiple nodes. |
| **Read Performance** | High, reads can be served locally. |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Requires robust conflict resolution mechanisms. |
| **Complexity** | High, due to conflict management and synchronization. |

## Trade-offs

- **Availability vs. Consistency**: Multi-leader replication provides high write availability, but it provides weaker consistency guarantees.
- **Performance vs. Complexity**: Multi-leader replication provides low write latency, but it is complex to implement and manage.

## Which service use it?



-   **Multi-Datacenter Deployments:** Organizations with a global presence often use multi-leader replication to allow writes to occur in different geographical regions, reducing latency for local users and improving disaster recovery capabilities.

-   **Some Distributed Databases (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Couchbase):** These NoSQL databases support multi-leader configurations, allowing any node to accept writes and then propagate them to other nodes in the cluster.

-   **Collaborative Applications with Local Writes:** Applications where users in different locations need to make concurrent updates to shared data, and local responsiveness is critical. Conflict resolution mechanisms are essential here.

-   **Offline-First Applications:** Mobile or desktop applications that allow users to make changes while offline, and then synchronize those changes with a central system (which might be multi-leader) when connectivity is restored.
