# Multi-Leader Replication

## Core

This section explains Multi-Leader Replication, a data replication strategy where multiple nodes can act as leaders, accepting writes and then replicating them to other leaders and followers, often used for multi-datacenter deployments.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Write Availability** | High, writes can occur at multiple nodes. |
| **Read Performance** | High, reads can be served locally. |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Requires robust conflict resolution mechanisms. |
| **Complexity** | High, due to conflict management and synchronization. |

## Which service use it?



-   **Multi-Datacenter Deployments:** Organizations with a global presence often use multi-leader replication to allow writes to occur in different geographical regions, reducing latency for local users and improving disaster recovery capabilities.

-   **Some Distributed Databases (e.g., Apache Cassandra, Couchbase):** These NoSQL databases support multi-leader configurations, allowing any node to accept writes and then propagate them to other nodes in the cluster.

-   **Collaborative Applications with Local Writes:** Applications where users in different locations need to make concurrent updates to shared data, and local responsiveness is critical. Conflict resolution mechanisms are essential here.

-   **Offline-First Applications:** Mobile or desktop applications that allow users to make changes while offline, and then synchronize those changes with a central system (which might be multi-leader) when connectivity is restored.

## Related Concepts

-   **Data Replication:** Multi-leader replication is a sophisticated data replication strategy that allows multiple nodes to accept writes simultaneously, enhancing write availability and local responsiveness. [Explore other Data Replication strategies](../README.md).

-   **Multi-Source Replication:** While both involve multiple origins, multi-source replication typically aggregates data from distinct sources into one, whereas multi-leader replication involves active, writable replicas synchronizing with each other, often leading to more complex conflict resolution. [Compare with Multi-Source Replication](../multi-source/README.md).

-   **Conflict Resolution:** A critical challenge in multi-leader replication is managing and resolving conflicts that inevitably arise when the same data is concurrently modified on different leader nodes. [Understand Conflict Resolution](../../conflict-resolution/README.md).

-   **Eventual Consistency:** Multi-leader replication typically results in eventual consistency, as updates from different leaders propagate asynchronously, meaning replicas may temporarily diverge before converging to a consistent state. [Explore Eventual Consistency](../../consistency-models/eventual-consistency/README.md).

-   **Fault Tolerance:** Multi-leader replication significantly enhances fault tolerance and disaster recovery capabilities by allowing writes to continue even if one or more leader nodes or entire data centers become unavailable. [Understand Fault Tolerance](../../fault-tolerance/README.md).

-   **Multi-Master System Mode:** Multi-leader replication is essentially the implementation of a multi-master system mode, where multiple nodes are designated as primary and can handle write operations. [Discover Multi-Master Systems](../../system-mode/multi-master/README.md).
