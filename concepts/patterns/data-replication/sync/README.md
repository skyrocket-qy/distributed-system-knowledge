# Synchronous Replication

## Core

This section describes Synchronous Replication, a data replication mode where the primary node waits for confirmation from replica nodes that they have received and committed the transaction before committing itself, prioritizing strong consistency.

## Characteristics

- **Strong Consistency**: Synchronous replication provides strong consistency, as all replicas are guaranteed to be up-to-date.
- **Zero Data Loss**: There is no data loss in the event of a primary node failure.
- **High Latency**: Write operations have higher latency, as they must be acknowledged by all replicas.
- **Low Availability**: The system may become unavailable if a replica node fails.
- **Complexity**: Synchronous replication is more complex to implement and manage than asynchronous replication.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Consistency** | Strong consistency, zero data loss. |
| **Performance** | Higher latency for writes. |
| **Availability** | Reduced availability during replica failures. |
| **Complexity** | More complex to implement and manage. |

## Trade-offs

- **Consistency vs. Performance**: Synchronous replication provides strong consistency, but it has higher latency than asynchronous replication.
- **Consistency vs. Availability**: Synchronous replication provides strong consistency, but it may become unavailable if a replica node fails.

## Which service use it?



-   **Financial Transaction Systems:** Banking, trading, and payment processing systems where data integrity and zero data loss are absolutely critical. Transactions must be committed on multiple nodes before being acknowledged to the client.

-   **Critical Enterprise Databases:** Databases storing highly sensitive or business-critical information where any data loss or inconsistency could have severe consequences.

-   **Distributed Consensus Systems (e.g., Paxos, Raft):** While not strictly a replication strategy in the same sense as database replication, consensus algorithms inherently use synchronous communication to ensure all participants agree on a state before proceeding.

-   **High-Availability Clusters:** In active-passive or active-active setups for critical applications, synchronous replication ensures that the standby node always has an up-to-date copy of the data.

## Related Concepts

-   **Data Replication:** Synchronous replication is a fundamental data replication strategy that prioritizes strong consistency by ensuring all replicas acknowledge an update before the transaction is committed. [Explore other Data Replication strategies](../README.md).

-   **Asynchronous Replication:** In contrast, asynchronous replication prioritizes performance and availability, allowing the primary to commit before replicas confirm, leading to eventual consistency. [Compare with Asynchronous Replication](../async/README.md).

-   **Semi-Synchronous Replication:** A hybrid approach that balances consistency and performance, where the primary waits for at least one replica to acknowledge the update before committing. [Explore Semi-Synchronous Replication](../semi-sync/README.md).

-   **Strong Consistency:** Synchronous replication is a primary mechanism for achieving strong consistency, guaranteeing that all reads return the most recent write and that data is consistent across all replicas. [Explore Strong Consistency](../../consistency-models/strong-consistency/README.md).

-   **Distributed Consensus:** Algorithms like Paxos or Raft often employ synchronous communication patterns to ensure that all participants agree on the order of operations and the state of the data, which is critical for synchronous replication. [Understand Distributed Consensus](../../distributed-consensus/README.md).

-   **Fault Tolerance:** While synchronous replication ensures zero data loss, it can impact availability during replica failures, as the primary might block until a quorum of replicas responds. [Understand Fault Tolerance](../../fault-tolerance/README.md).
