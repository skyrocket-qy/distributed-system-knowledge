# System Design

This section provides an overview of system design principles and how they apply to distributed systems. It serves as a bridge between the foundational concepts and the practical application of designing and building scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems.

## Core

## Characteristics

- **Scalability**: The ability to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources.
- **Reliability**: The probability that a system will produce correct outputs and not fail.
- **Availability**: The percentage of time that the system is operational.
- **Efficiency**: The ratio of useful output to total input.
- **Maintainability**: The ease with which a system can be repaired or modified.
