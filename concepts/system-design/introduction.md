# Introduction to System Design

## Core

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. In the context of distributed systems, it involves making critical decisions about how to structure and operate a collection of independent computers to achieve a common goal.

The primary objective of system design is to create a solution that is scalable, reliable, and maintainable. This requires a deep understanding of the trade-offs between various design choices and the ability to balance competing constraints.

Key principles of system design include:

-   **Scalability:** The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work.
-   **Reliability:** The ability of a system to continue operating in the event of failures.
-   **Availability:** The percentage of time that a system is operational.
-   **Performance:** The speed and efficiency of a system.
-   **Security:** The protection of a system from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
