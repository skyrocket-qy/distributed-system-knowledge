# Sequential Consistency

## Core

Sequential consistency is a strong consistency model that ensures that the result of any execution is the same as if all operations by all processes were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual process appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program. In simpler terms, it means that all processes see all operations in the same global order, even if the actual physical order of execution differs.

## How It Works

Sequential consistency is achieved by ensuring that:

1.  **Global Order:** All read and write operations from all processes appear to execute in a single, total order.
2.  **Program Order:** Operations from a single process appear in this global order in the sequence specified by that process's program.

This model does not require that this global order be the same as the real-time order of operations. It only requires that *some* global sequential order exists that is consistent with the program order of individual processes.

## Comparison

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Ordering** | Total order of all operations, preserving program order. |
| **Strength** | Strongest consistency model. |
| **Performance** | High latency due to strict ordering and coordination. |
| **Complexity** | Complex to implement and scale in distributed systems. |

## Trade-offs

### Pros

*   **Easier to Reason About:** Developers can reason about the system as if there were a single, centralized memory, simplifying concurrent programming.
*   **Strong Guarantees:** Provides strong guarantees about the order and visibility of operations, making it easier to write correct distributed applications.

### Cons

*   **Performance Overhead:** Achieving sequential consistency often involves significant coordination overhead, leading to higher latency and lower throughput compared to weaker consistency models.
*   **Reduced Availability:** The strict ordering requirements can reduce the availability of the system, as operations might need to wait for acknowledgments from multiple nodes.
*   **Complexity of Implementation:** Implementing sequential consistency in a distributed system is complex and can be challenging to scale.

## Use Cases

*   **Distributed Shared Memory Systems:** Where multiple processors access a common memory space.
*   **Critical Sections:** In distributed systems where certain operations must be executed atomically and in a strict order.
*   **Debugging and Testing:** Provides a strong baseline for understanding and verifying the behavior of distributed algorithms.

## Examples

*   **Transactional Databases:** While not always strictly sequential, many transactional databases aim for strong consistency models that are close to sequential consistency for critical operations.
*   **Distributed Consensus Algorithms:** Algorithms like Paxos or Raft, which are used to achieve agreement among distributed processes, often provide guarantees that can be considered sequentially consistent for the agreed-upon values.
