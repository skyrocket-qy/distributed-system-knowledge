# Glossary

This glossary defines common terms used in the study of distributed systems.

## Core Concepts

**Distributed System**
: A collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system.

**Concurrency**
: The ability of a system to execute multiple computations at the same time.

**CAP Theorem**
: A theorem that states it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

## System Properties

**Consistency**
: The guarantee that all nodes in a distributed system have the same view of the data at any given time.

**Fault Tolerance**
: The ability of a system to continue operating in the event of failures.

**Scalability**
: The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to the system.

**Latency**
: The time it takes for a message to travel from its source to its destination.

## Communication

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
: A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

**Asynchronous**
: A mode of communication where the sender and receiver do not need to be available at the same time.

**Synchronous**
: A mode of communication where the sender and receiver must be available at the same time.
